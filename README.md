# LedMatrixDriver for Rainboduino

Dear all,

I have a [Rainbowduino](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Rainbowduino-LED-driver-platform-Atmega-328-p-371.html) board and now it's time to build up a small project on it. So the main goal is to implement small games for a 8x8 RGB LED matrix. At the moment the first tasks are:
- [ ] create an own driver for the Rainboduino in C++
- [ ] implement a middleware for the communication over serial port in Arduino code
- [ ] build a frontend for the user in python (first game should be a labyrinth)
- [ ] have fun to play games on it

Feel free to help me. I hope I have enought time to get the main goal.

Cheers,
Friedl
